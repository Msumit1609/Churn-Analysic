## Customer Churn Analysis

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting **customer churn** using data-driven approaches. By exploring customer behavior and historical data, the project identifies key factors
that contribute to churn and applies machine learning models to predict whether a customer is likely to leave. The insights gained can help businesses design effective **retention strategies** and reduce customer loss.
